# Core action plan

Goal: a minimal core that is usable every day within a couple of days, built on the [core design](../design/core.md). Every step ends with green architecture and unit tests.

## Phase 0: Spikes

Throwaway experiments that answer questions the design depends on. Results are written down here, and the code is deleted.

| Question | Why it matters | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| How well does each agent implement ACP? | Sizes the Agents module and the first providers | Claude Code, Codex and Gemini tried through ACP, gaps listed |
| Which agents stream partial output? | Decides how the canvas streams | Partial output observed or ruled out per agent |
| Does Avalonia's WebView work on Linux, and under which license? | Decides how the canvas renders | Renders on Hyprland, license confirmed |
| Does Stateless export Mermaid diagrams? | Decides whether diagrams are generated | Answered: yes, through `Stateless.Graph.MermaidGraph` |

## Phase 1: Foundations

Status: done, except the rule on provider names, which arrives with the first provider.

1. Rename the sample module from Tasks to Jobs.
2. Add `Result<TValue, TError>` with `Match` and `TryGetValue` to the SDK, with unit tests.
3. Add `IIntegrationEvent`, `IEventBus`, `IHandle<T>`, `IEventFeed` and `IUiDispatcher` to the SDK.
4. Implement the bus and the feed in `Avala.Runtime` with `System.Threading.Channels`, with unit tests for ordering, isolation of failing handlers and cancellation.
5. Add the marker interfaces `IAggregateRoot` and `IDomainEvent` to the SDK.
6. Add Stateless to central package management, with the guarded transition helper, and ban direct `Fire` calls.
7. Add ArchUnitNET and the DDD and boundary rules listed in the [core design](../design/core.md#architecture-rules-to-add).
8. Add the fixtures assembly that violates every rule on purpose, and test each rule against it.
9. Change the plugin rule to one plugin entry per module.

Done when: the SDK contracts exist, the bus is tested, and every rule detects its fixture.

## Phase 2: Jobs domain

Status: done. Attempts turned out to need no state machine of their own, see the [core design](../design/core.md#state-machines).

1. `JobId`, `AttemptBudget` and the other value objects.
2. `JobError` and the error codes.
3. `JobLifecycle` with Stateless, guarded by `CanFire`, and its diagram generated from the code.
4. The `Job` aggregate returning events inside results.
5. Unit tests for every transition, every guard and every error code.

Done when: every allowed and forbidden transition is covered by a test, and no test needs infrastructure.

## Phase 3: Agents core

Status: done. The agnostic events also carry telemetry and streaming canvases.

1. `Agents.Contracts`: `IAgentProvider`, `IAgentSession`, the agnostic events, `AgentCapabilities`, `AgentError`.
2. `TurnLifecycle` with expiry driven by `TimeProvider`.
3. A fake provider for tests that replays scripted events.
4. The skeleton of the conformance kit.

Done when: `TurnLifecycle` rejects every malformed sequence in its tests, and the fake provider passes the kit.

## Phase 4: Workspaces

Status: done. Persistence with EF Core arrived in phase 5.

1. An asynchronous process runner for git, with no blocking calls.
2. `WorkspaceLifecycle` and the `Workspace` aggregate.
3. Worktree creation and disposal, plus a checkpoint per turn.
4. Integration tests against a real temporary git repository, since this behavior cannot be verified otherwise.

Done when: a workspace is created, checkpointed and disposed on Linux and Windows.

## Phase 5: Job flow

Status: items 1 to 6 are done, with `Option<T>`, the rule that keeps nullable types out of signatures and the persistence rules that keep EF Core in `Infrastructure` and database work off the UI thread. An end-to-end integration test of the flow is being finished.

1. The job flow coordinator as event handlers.
2. `ICompletionGate`, with every attempt passing when no gate is registered.
3. Recovery on startup from stored state.
4. Persistence for Jobs and Workspaces with EF Core and SQLite, one `DbContext` and one database file per module.
5. Keep database work off the UI thread, with an architecture rule that verifies it.
6. The [Verification](../design/core.md#verification) module, a plugin of its own: a completion gate that runs the checks a repository declares in `.avala/checks.json` inside the worktree, each with its timeout, sends the failures back to the agent through the retry path, and publishes the evidence of every attempt as `AttemptVerified`, queryable through `IVerifications`. A host simulation test proves that a job whose declared check fails reaches review only after the agent fixes it. Deferred: reading the declaration from the job's base commit so the agent cannot change it, live progress of a running check, and persisting the reports.

Done when: a job goes from submitted to awaiting review with the fake provider, survives a restart midway, and handlers stay idempotent.

## Phase 6: First provider

Status: item 1 is done.

1. A simulated Claude Code provider that uses only the public agent contracts: declarative scenarios chosen by a tag in the first message, real file edits, permission requests answered through `IAgents.RespondAsync`, and failure scenarios that the conformance kit must report.
2. The Claude Code provider plugin.
3. It passes the conformance kit with recorded sessions.
4. The architecture rule that keeps provider names inside their own plugin.
5. The canvas tool the harness injects through MCP, translated into the canvas events the Canvas module already consumes.

Done when: a real job runs end to end with Claude Code.

## Phase 7: Observability

Status: done with the fake provider and the simulator. Two items wait for the real Claude Code provider of phase 6: aggregating by account, since no event carries the account yet, and checking that its turns show up in the aggregates. The view models of the usage dashboards moved to phase 9.

1. `SessionOpened` from Agents and `JobSessionStarted` from Jobs, so a session's activity can be tied to its provider and its job.
2. The Observability module: aggregates tokens, cost per currency, unpriced reports, limits and turns by outcome with their durations, by provider, session and job, behind `IUsage` in its contracts.
3. Metrics through `System.Diagnostics.Metrics`: the `Avala.Observability` meter with tokens, cost, turns, turn durations and limits.
4. A simulation test of the real application: a simulated job's tokens, cost, turn and limit show up in the aggregates of its job and its provider.

Done when: every turn of the fake and real providers shows up in the aggregates, with unit tests.

## Phase 8: Canvas

Status: done. The MCP canvas tool moved to phase 6, with the real provider; the canvas view model to phase 9 and the renderers to phase 10, with the rest of the user interface.

1. The Canvas module, a plugin of its own: the `CanvasDocument` aggregate with `CanvasLifecycle` and its generated diagram, accumulating each canvas from `CanvasStarted`, `ItemProgressed` and `ItemCompleted` and rejecting foreign, repeated and late content with typed errors.
2. Snapshots throttled per canvas with `TimeProvider`, published as `CanvasUpdated` with the full content so far and flushed at once on completion.
3. `Canvas.Contracts`: `CanvasId`, `CanvasSnapshot`, `CanvasUpdated` and the `ICanvases` query of a session's current canvases.
4. A host simulation test: the simulator's `canvas` scenario delivers its SVG and Mermaid canvases as snapshots that grow in order and end complete.

Done when: a canvas streamed by the simulator reaches the bus as snapshots in order, with unit tests. Met.

## Phase 8b: Permissions

Status: done with the simulator. Reading the policy from the committed base rather than the worktree, and opening sessions in `AskEveryTime` so that edits also reach the policy, wait for the real Claude Code provider of phase 6.

1. `PermissionRequested` names its item kind and its target, `SessionOpened` its working directory, and the conformance kit reports requests that name no target or another kind than their item.
2. The Permissions module, a plugin of its own: ordered rules with first-match semantics and a default `Ask`, scoped to the workspace for file edits, with a built-in guard that sends edits of the policy file to a human.
3. A repository policy in `.avala/permissions.json`, parsed strictly; an invalid file is reported with a typed `PolicyError` and falls back to the built-in policy.
4. `PermissionResponder` answers `Allow` and `Deny` through `IAgents.RespondAsync` and leaves `Ask` pending; every decision is published as `PermissionDecided` with the rule that made it, and is queryable by session and job through `IPermissionAudit`.
5. Host simulation tests with the `permission` scenario: an allowing policy lets the job finish unattended, a denying policy is answered `Deny`, and without a policy the request awaits a human, with the decision audited in each case.

Done when: a simulated job that asks permission finishes unattended under a repository policy, and every decision is audited. Met.

## Phase 9: View models of the usable core

The whole application works through view models, with no user interface.

1. Job list, new job and job detail.
2. Timeline projection and the activity view: messages, reasoning, tools and canvases, the canvas view model reading `ICanvases` and following `CanvasUpdated`.
3. Diff review: approve, send back or discard.
4. Usage dashboards over `IUsage`: by provider, by job and by session.

Done when: the full job flow runs end to end through view models in tests.

## Phase 10: Views

1. Avalonia views for every view model, semi-transparent with themes, Inter for the interface and JetBrains Mono for code.
2. The canvas surface for each media type, with renderer plugins registered by media type.

Done when: the harness replaces a terminal for daily work.
